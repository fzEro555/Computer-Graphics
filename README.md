# Computer-Graphics

This is the homework for Intro to Computer Graphics.

For all the projects. I use webgl2.

For HW1 I created a WebGL context and cleared the graphic context to a specific color 
and extend the demo by adding three slider controls that allow you to change the clearColor.

For HW2 I drew a triangle where at least one of the vertices of the triangle can be manipulated by user controls (sliders). 
The controls will change the vertex position along the x-axis and the y-axis.

HW3 is almost the same as HW2 except that I used uniform.

For HW4 I drew a rotated triangle.

Robot is a robot that can be manipulated by user controls. It has a head, body and an arm.
When the body move, the head and the arm will also move.
When the body rotate, the arm will also rotate.

3d world contains a ground and several objects that are moving. Some objects depend on each other. 
The user can move around the world by click the keyboard.

Final project contains 3 separate models.
Models are graphic scene that include vertices, textures and lighting. Refrain from trivialmodels.
Resources from the model are to be retrieved via a suitable http requires (fetch, asyncrequest, etc.)
The user can move around the world by click the keyboard.
